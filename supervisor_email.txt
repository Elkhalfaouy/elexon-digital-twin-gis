🎯 KEY CAPABILITIES:

1. STRATEGIC DASHBOARD
   • Real-time KPI monitoring (peak load, daily profit, service levels, energy metrics)
   • Financial performance tracking with EBITDA and ROI calculations
   • System health monitoring (grid status, service quality alerts)
   • Dynamic charger utilization gauges

2. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
   • 15-year NPV and IRR calculations
   • Detailed CAPEX breakdown (hardware, civil works, grid connection, renewables)
   • OPEX modeling (energy costs, maintenance, labor, insurance)
   • Break-even analysis with customizable tariff structures
   • Sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios

3. OPERATIONAL OPTIMIZATION
   • Queue simulation using Erlang-C models
   • Service level optimization (target: 99%+ availability)
   • Dynamic demand forecasting (hourly/seasonal patterns)
   • Charger mix optimization (HPC 350kW vs AC 22kW)
   • Battery storage integration for peak shaving

4. GIS DIGITAL TWIN
   • 90+ pre-scored sites across German highway network (A1-A99)
   • Interactive map with grid capacity, traffic density, competition analysis
   • Site ranking by financial viability, grid availability, and strategic position
   • Manual coordinate input for custom site evaluation
   • Export scored sites to CSV for further analysis

5. PROFESSIONAL SITE LAYOUT
   • DIN EN 61851 & VDE 0122 compliant engineering blueprints
   • Interactive bay design (18-20m × 4-5m with safety clearances)
   • Zone positioning for HPC, AC chargers, transformers, and BESS
   • Site context integration showing available area and grid capacity

6. SERVICE LEVEL MANAGEMENT
   • Real-time compliance dashboard (EN 61851, VDE 0122, ISO 15118)
   • Service quality tracking with color-coded alerts
   • Queue management with wait time analysis
   • Revenue loss calculations from service degradation

7. COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING
   • Professional 6-page PDF export:
     - Executive Summary with key findings
     - Financial Analysis (NPV, IRR, payback, cash flows)
     - Operational Performance (service levels, utilization, energy)
     - Queue & Service Metrics
     - Compliance Status
     - Risk Analysis
   • Publication-ready charts and tables

8. SCENARIO COMPARISON
   • Save multiple configurations (A, B, C)
   • Side-by-side comparison of CAPEX, service levels, profitability
   • Trend analysis across scenarios
   • Automated best-scenario recommendations

⚙️ TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE:
• German Engineering Standards (DIN EN 61851, VDE 0122)
• European Grid Codes (EN 50160)
• International Charging Standards (ISO 15118, IEC 61851)
• Financial modeling aligned with German tax and subsidy frameworks

📈 USE CASES:
• Site selection and feasibility assessment
• Investment decision support
• Grid impact analysis for TSO coordination
• Operational planning and resource allocation
• Regulatory compliance verification
• Stakeholder presentations with professional reports

💼 NEXT STEPS:
I recommend scheduling a brief demonstration session to walk through specific scenarios relevant to our strategic priorities. The tool is ready for immediate use in evaluating potential sites and supporting investment decisions.

The platform is hosted 24/7 and accessible from any device. All calculations are based on validated engineering models and German market data.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or would like to schedule a detailed walkthrough.
